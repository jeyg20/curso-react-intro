Welcome to the React Todo App, a fork of the [curso-react-intro](https://github.com/platzi/curso-react-intro) project. This application provides users with a streamlined interface for managing tasks effortlessly. Whether you're creating new tasks, marking them as completed, or deleting them, the app ensures a user-friendly experience.

## Try it Out üîó
Check out the live application [here](https://jeyg20.github.io/react-todo-app/).

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and lint errors will be visible in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder. This process bundles React in production mode, optimizing the build for optimal performance. The resulting app is ready for deployment.

For more information on deployment, check the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there's no turning back!**

If you're dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can use `eject` to gain full control over them. This command copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. While all commands except `eject` will still work, they'll now point to the copied scripts.

You don't have to use `eject`; the curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments. However, the flexibility to customize is there when you're ready for it.

Feel free to explore and enhance the React Todo App according to your preferences! üöÄ
